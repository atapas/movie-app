# Why React

The `Why React` project shows how `React` can be used .

- React is Declarative.
- React is easy to learn.
- It is Fast.
- JSX is simple.
- It is Component-based.
- It is fun to use.
- Write Once, Use Everywhere

Well, React is way more than what has been demonstrated here. The idea is to bring a pointer where "sky is the only limit"

Happy Coding!
