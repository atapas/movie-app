# Random Background Generator

## What is it about?

This play is about generating and downloading random background.

## How I created it-

I've got the idea from an vanilla javascript project from youtube. My goal was to convert it from vanilla to react. It was hard to start but easy to finish.

## Libraries used-

-> "animejs" for the animation and transition you see.
-> "html2canvas" to convert the background html div to canvas element.

## Challenges faced-

-> Positioning the blocks was a challange for me.
-> Another challange was to work with huge node_modules. The overall work environment slowed down for the big dipendency tree.
