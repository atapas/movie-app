This is a weather app ,where the user searches for the name of a city or town and gets current weather, chance of rainfall, hourly weather forecast and 7 day weather forecast of the city or town

## Consideration

This App uses a weather api from https://weatherapi.com and requires an API key which can be generated in this website  https://www.weatherapi.com/my/

Set the environment variable API_KEY in ./components/SearchBar.jsx to the API key gerated from the WeatherApi website
