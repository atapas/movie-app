# Product entry form
The `Product entry form` is a project where you can add products or anything with the given 5 inputs(name, image url, description, price and date), the project will be added in the list and can filter by the date which you've entered.

Concepts I used:-

- Form Handling.
- Input Validation
- Use of `useState` hook.
- CSS modules for object based classes.
- Array filter for filtering the list according to the year.

If there is an empty `input` or any `invalid` price value, it will show an error. We have error.

Here the `ProductEntryForm.jsx` file responsible for the rendering of this app.
